The BSD 0-clause license goes further than the 2-clause license by dropping the requirements to include the copyright notice, license text, or disclaimer in either source or binary forms. Doing so forms a public-domain-equivalent license,[18] the same way as MIT No Attribution License.[citation needed] It is known as "0BSD", "Zero-Clause BSD", or "Free Public License 1.0.0".[19][20] It was created by Rob Landley and first used in Toybox when he was disappointed after using GPL license in BusyBox.[21]
